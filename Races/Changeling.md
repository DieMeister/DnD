# Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse
**With ever-changing appearances, changelings reside i  many societies undetected. Each changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like. For some changelings, a new face is only a disguise. For other changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.**  

**The first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable essence of the plane lingers in changelings today - even in those changelings who have never set a foot in the fey realm. Each changeling decides how to use their shape-shifting ability, channeling either the peril or the joy of the Feywild. Sometimes they adopt new forms for the sake of mischief or malice, and other times they don a new identity to right wrongs or delight the downtrodden.**  

**In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape - one created on the spur purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth, crafting whole personas complete with histories and beliefs. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.**  

**Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; a community might be home to three healer changelings, with whoever is on duty adopting the persona of Andrea, the gentle physician. Personas can even passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contracts established by the persona's previous users.**
