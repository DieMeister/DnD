You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire's space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make a saving throw when it enters the bonfire's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.  
**At Higher Levels.** The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level(3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
