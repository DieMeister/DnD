You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (Though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.  
**At Higher Levels.** This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
