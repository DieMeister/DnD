You pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast the spell again. the thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. it is otherwise stationary.  
If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as [detect thoughts](../Level2/Detect%20Thoughts.md) or [[Modify Memory]]), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.  
Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting [detect thoughts](../Level2/Detect%20Thoughts.md) on the strand has the same effect.)
