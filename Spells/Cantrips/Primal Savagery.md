You channel primal magic to cause your teeth or fingernails to sharpen, ready to deliver a corrosive attack. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 acid damage. After you make the attack, your teeth or fingernails return to normal.  
**At Higher Levels.** The spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level  (4d10).
