You gesture one humanoid you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target must move up to its speed in a direction you choose. In addition, you can cause the target to drop whatever it is holding. This spell has no effect on a humanoid that is immune to being charmed.  
HB Suggestion: This spell is somewhat overpowered. Forced movement is one thing, but forced disarmament is very strong. I would recommend allowing only forced movement or forced disarmament, not both.
