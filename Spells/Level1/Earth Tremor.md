You cause a tremor in the ground in a 10-foot radius. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared.  
**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
