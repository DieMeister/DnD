**Material Component:** alchemist's supplies  
You create a healing elixir in a simple vial that appears in your hand. The elixir retains its potency for the duration or until it's consumed, at which point the vial vanishes.  
As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to another creature. The drinker regains 2d4 + 2 hit points.  
**HB Note:** This spell is massively overpowered. For example, a 1st-level wizard could use this spell to produce enough healing for an entire party without losing any spell slots. Additionally, it could be used to run a potion-selling scam in which the product vanishes a day after purchase. I would not recommend allowing it.  
Editor's Note: I don't have a clue as to what the first point is referring to, arcane recovery only gives 1 spell slot until 4th level, spell mastery is at 18th level, and any abusable subclass features are at 2nd level. But yes, either way, this spell is overpowered, it gives non-divine caster classes access to healing, and it can be abused in numerous ways. I'd suggest limiting the duration to an hour or less.  
Editor notes+: At higher levels, this allows wizards to heal creatures infinitely, and overall, wizards just shouldn't have healing spells, it goes against their design philosophy. On the warlock, its also still a confusing option, as though warlocks can gain healing spells through a celestial patron, this spell lacks any upcasting rules, which goes against the design of warlock.
