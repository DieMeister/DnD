**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.  
A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.  
If you choose a target that is held shut with [[Arcane Lock]], that spell us suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.  
When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.
