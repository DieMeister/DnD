This is a copy of my DnD ObsidianVault. This includes general DnD information as well as notes to the ongoing campaign "Buried beneath Graves" and obsidian specific folders such as  `./.obsidan/`. Feel free to click through it and let it inspire you.
# For people who know the campaign
For you, the most important folder is probably the campaign folder `./BuriedBeneathGraves/`. It includes all the information i was yet able to extract from the audio files as well as the cut audio itself. It does neither include the raw audio nor the audacity files due to file sizes.  
Everything is structured in its corresponding folder though it might be helpful to check [my Notes](./BuriedBeneathGraves/Notes.md) too, especially for newer information.
